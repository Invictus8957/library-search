thinking just aboutl libby interactions, ideally, would be able to:
1. ask what libraries you have a card for 
1. store those libraries somewhere (config file? sqlite?)
1. query for an entry by title/author across those libraries and aggregate results



things that would be interesting to do:
1. search libraries via libby
1. search libraries for "real" books
1. search kindle unlimited inclusions
1. do all of the above from the same interface to make it seamless

Probably can't "check out" books without getting into questionable security territory.
